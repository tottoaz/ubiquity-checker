# How to use
* You must have node installed on your computer
* npm install
* node ubiquity-checker.js
* Modify the "urls" array to contain the products you want to check.
* Test that the mp3 will play on your system without error by forcing the condition to true and running. You don't want to find out that it doesn't work when something is actually in stock.

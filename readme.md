# How to use

* You must have node installed on your computer https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Download or clone this repo
* In the same directory as the script run `npm install`
* And then run `node ubiquiti-checker.js`

# Modification

* Modify the config.js file to suit your needs, urls placed in the urlsToCheck array are the ones the script is going to check
* Test that the mp3 will play on your system without error by forcing the condition to true and running. You don't want
  to find out that it doesn't work when something is actually in stock.
